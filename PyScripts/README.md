Python scripts for MHC Evo data visualization
----------------------------------------------

The scripts are written in Python 3.6. We recommend Anaconda scientific Python distribution for using them:
https://www.anaconda.com/download/

When you have Anaconda installed run:
```shell
conda env create -f mhcEvoCondaEnv.yaml
```
to get all the stuff you need to run the scripts (and unfortunately some more...)

Still working on some scripts after switching to JSON as the format of the *Input Parameters* file.
